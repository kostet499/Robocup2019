# Robocup2019

# 1) The pre-requisites:

    -> sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall 

    -> sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libc6-i386 libbz2-dev 

# 2) Install: Python 2.7 (only) + CMake + QTCreator 

    -> sudo apt-get install gcc cmake qtcreator 

    -> cd /usr/src 

    -> wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/Python-2.7.13.tgz 

    -> tar xzf Python-2.7.13.tgz 

    -> cd Python-2.7.13 

    -> sudo ./configure 

    -> sudo make altinstall 

# 3) Install: qiBuild 

    -> sudo apt install python-pip

    -> pip install qibuild

  If qiBuild doesn't launch: 

        -> gedit ~/.bashrc 
  
  and in the end of the file add: 
  
        export PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/.local/bin

 # 4) Install SDK and cross-toolchain

    -> git clone https://github.com/MolVlad/Robocup2019
    
You should create a new branch with your last name:
    
    -> git checkout -b your_last_name
    
Then you should write me your login in GitHub, so that I will add you to the list of collaborators (link to my page: vk.com/molvlad)

After that you will be able make changes and save them on your branch (names_of_modified_files - files you want to save):

    -> git add names_of_modified_files
    
    -> git commit -m "message for the other people"
    
    -> git push origin your_last_name
    
Note: you should work only in your branch!

# 5) Configuration: qiBuild Toolchains

 You can just execute my script:
 
    -> ./config_toolchain
    
 or configure manually:

 Configure toolchain for the desktop:
 
    -> qitoolchain create desktop Robocup2019/naoqi/toolchain.xml
  
    -> qibuild add-config desktop -t desktop
  
  Configure toolchain for the robot:
  
    -> qitoolchain create robot /toolchain.xml
  
    -> qibuild add-config robot -t robot                                       

 # 6) Compile the Program C++ with the SDK - ALDEBARAN

Create a new project (if it's necessary, or move to the directory with example):

    -> qisrc create template
    
Note: All examples on C++ are in Robocup2019/naoqi/workspace

Then init worktree:

    -> qibuild init
    
Below "toolchain" means "toolchain_for_desktop", if you want to build for the desktop, or "toolchain_for_robot" otherwise:
    
    -> qibuild configure -c toolchain
    
    -> qibuild make -c toolchain
    
 # 7) Start the Project 
 
 If you build your project for the desktop:
 
    -> cd build-toolchain_for_the_robot/sdk/bin
    
 Below "example" is the name of your program, "IP_address" - IP address of the robot, "your_directory" - directory with your last name in the robot (read "Note" at the end).
    
    -> ./example IP_address
    
 If you build your project for the robot:
 
     -> cd build-toolchain_for_the_robot/sdk/bin
     
    -> scp example nao@IP_address:/home/nao/your_directory
    
    -> ssh nao@IP_address
    
    -> ./your_directory/example IP_address
    
# Note:

To work with the robot you should create on him a new directory with your last name and copy files there. Otherwise everything will be remove.

If you want to create a local module, at the end of building you will get a static library .so, that cannot be run as an ordinary program.
